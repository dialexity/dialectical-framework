    Given the initial context and the previous dialectical analysis, suggest solution(s).
    
    Step 1: Frame the problem as a tension between two opposing approaches, where:
    - Thesis (T): The first approach or position
    - Antithesis (A): The contrasting approach or position
    
    The solution that is suggested or implied in the text must represent the Linear Action (Ac) that transforms the negative aspect of the thesis (T-) into the positive aspect of the antithesis (A+)
    
    Step 2: Create a Dialectical Reflection (Re):
    - A complementary solution that is NOT present in the analyzed text
    - This solution should transform the negative aspect of the antithesis (A-) into the positive aspect of the thesis (T+)
    - It should work harmoniously with the Linear Action to create a more complete solution
    
    <example>
        For example:
        In a token vesting dispute, stakeholders disagreed about extending the lock period from January 2025 to January 2026. The original solution was a staged distribution with incentives.
        
        Thesis T: Vest Now
        T+ = Trust Building
        T- = Loss of Value
        
        Antithesis A: Vest Later
        A+ = Value Protection (contradicts T-)
        A- = Trust Erosion (contradicts T+)
        
        Linear Action: Staged distribution with added incentives, offering 25% immediate unlock with enhanced benefits for the delayed 75% portion.
        
        Dialectical Reflection: Liquid staking derivatives for immediate utility (25%) combined with guaranteed exit rights (75%) - complements the linear action.
    </example>
    </instructions>

    <formatting>
    Output Linear Action and Dialectical Reflection as a fluent text that could be useful for someone who provided the initial context. Compose the problem statement in the passive voice. Don't mention any special denotations such as "T", "T+", "A-", "Ac", "Re", etc.
