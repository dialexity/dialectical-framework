In nature, summer follows spring rather than preceding it, and the Earth's orbit and axial tilt create a fixed seasonal pattern of Spring → Summer → Fall → Winter, which then repeats. The only way this cycle could exist would be if we're discussing a hypothetical planet with different orbital mechanics or perhaps in discussion of hemispheric differences (when it's summer in the Northern hemisphere, it's winter in the Southern hemisphere, followed by spring).\n",

This is a well-established astronomical and meteorological cycle caused by the Earth's axial tilt and orbit around the sun. As the Earth orbits, different hemispheres receive varying amounts of direct sunlight, creating the predictable seasonal pattern we observe annually.\n",

This sequence is the foundation for understanding natural ecosystems, animal migration patterns, and plant life cycles.\n",
